# _Variables_

## _Assignment_

Variables can be assigned and reassigned without a keyword:

```
a = 5;

a = a + 1;
```

## _Primitives_

### _Boolean_

A boolean can created with the `true` or `false` keywords:

```
a = true;

b = false;
```

### _Integer_

```
a = 5;
```

### _Float_

Floats are initialized with the accessor operator (`.`) on an integer:

```
a = 1.23;
```

Floats can also be initialized with a decimal value of 0:

```
a = 1.0;
```


### _Rune_

A Rune is the equivalent of a unicode character, and can be either a UInt8, UInt16, or UInt32. Runes are initialized with single quotes:

```
a = 'a';

b = 'ðŸ•Š';
```

### _String_

Strings are lists of Runes, and are initialized with double quotes:
```
a = "Sindarin ðŸ•Š";
```
